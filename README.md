This is a simple mini project in order to do 2 things:

1. I can practice my Rust basic syntax (like loops, variables, functions)
2. I can test the Codex from OpenAI as a Pair Programmer

The idea is that Codex acts as the passenger and I act as the pilot
Codex will see my code, review it and sometimes explain me things where I get stuck
Important: He will NOT code anything, just review it
